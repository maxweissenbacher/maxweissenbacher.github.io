I am currently studying for my PhD in Mathematics at Imperial College London under the supervision of Martin Taylor and Gustav Holzegel. In my research, I study the stability and instability properties of extremal black holes of the theory of general relativity.

On this page I provide an explanation of my research in non-technical terms.

## Black holes

## Talks

I have given talks on my research and other topics on several occasions. 

- Monthly seminar on General Relativity and Hyperbolic PDE (21. 10. 2022, online, [slides]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link /presentationGRonline.pdf %}))
- Junior Analysis Seminar (26. 10. 2022, London)
- Imperial Summer Analysis School (16. 06. 2021, online)

During my PhD, I also co-organised the [Junior Analysis Seminar](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/pure-analysis-and-pdes/seminars/jas/) in the academic years 2020-21 and 2021-22.
