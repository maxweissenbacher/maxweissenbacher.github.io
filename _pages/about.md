I am a Research Associate in the Department of Mathematics in the group of Anastasia Borovykh at Imperial College London, also affiliated with Imperial-X.
My research focuses on combining deep learning with mathematical physics. I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning. To find out more about my current and past projects, navigate to the [Projects page](/projects).
