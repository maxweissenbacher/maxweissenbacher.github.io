I am a Research Associate in the Department of Mathematics in the group of Anastasia Borovykh at Imperial College London, also affiliated with Imperial-X.
My research focuses on combining deep learning with mathematical physics. I am particularly interested in reinforcement learning.

I obtained my PhD at Imperial College London. My thesis investigated the stability and instability of extremal black holes in general relativity.
