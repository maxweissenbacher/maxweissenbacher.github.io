title: About me
---

I am currently a 3rd year PhD student in Mathematics at Imperial College London. For my PhD I study the dynamics of extremal black holes. Alongside this, I have also worked on personal projects in statistics and machine learning. Contributing to data science for public good is what I would like to do next. Outside of work, I'm a keen triathlete and you can often find me in the kitchen trying out a new recipe for my next adventure.
