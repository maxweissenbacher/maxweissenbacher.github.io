Week 7 of Dr. Anastasia Borovykh's course on Mathematical Foundations of Machine Learning at Imperial College London, spring term 2024. 

The lecture introduces the idea of contrastive learning, a type of self-supervised learning.
It discusses common types of contrastive losses and their interpretations, along with many applications and pitfalls to watch out for.

Take a look at the [lecture slides](../contrastive_loss_lecture_for_website.pdf) and accompanying Jupyter notebook!
